**This is a *config flow* component**.


> WARNING: If you are updating from a previous version you should delete any configuration text related with this integration from your `configuration.yaml`, since *yaml configuration* is now **NOT supported** and this integration will **STOP to work (if you don't do it)**!.

Main change:

You don't need to know anymore the `country` and `language`ISO codes, **choose by name in your native language**.


A very useful set of automations are in the [documentation][1]. You can have more like these by consulting the [HA Forum][2].
